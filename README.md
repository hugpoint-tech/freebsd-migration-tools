# FreeBSD Migration Tools

This repository contains tools for various migration tasks between FreeBSD systems:
- bugzilla -> forgejo(bugs, comments and attachments)
- phabricator -> forgejo (not certain yet)


## Findings
- no clear 1-1 mapping between Bug fields from Bugzilla and Issue in Gitea
- email cannot be used as name (as it was in Bugzilla)
